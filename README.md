# CatHub

CatHub is a group project that was built during my time at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/career-support/). It is designed to replicate the functionality of Facebook, but for a slightly different audience: cats!

# Technology Used

This project uses Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Capybara, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and BootStrap.
